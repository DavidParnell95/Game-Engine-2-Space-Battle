Inspiration for this project came from the start of the "Suicide Mission"
from Bioware's Mass Effect 2, and is themed around the ships that entered the Omega 4 Relay prior to the events of the game.
This scene involves 1 ship venturing into an area of space where none return from. The scene involves multiple smaller drones/fighter ships 
attacking the main ship in a field of debris.
